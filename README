Descirption:
This is a wordpress plugin.  It uses jQuery to animate and do the necessary ajax to dynamically pull images and content from the WordPress database.

Current Version: 1.1

Log:
1.1	It works, but there maybe some room for improvement.  Using AJAX to dynamically add images to Carousel is a bit weird.
